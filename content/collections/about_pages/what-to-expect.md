        text: 'We welcome anyone to join us in person for worship on Sunday mornings. Our congregation is multi-ethnic and intergenerational, and we come from various church backgrounds. Our Sunday morning worship service begins at 10:00 a.m. The sanctuary is located just up the stairs once you enter the church’s front doors. One of the ushers will give you a worship booklet, which gives you an outline of the service. You can sit wherever you like in the sanctuary. We offer simultaneous Spanish translation and you can pick up a headset just outside the sanctuary entrance, or ask an usher or greeter to help you.'

        text: 'Our worship service begins with a call to worship, usually based on a passage of Scripture, followed by congregational singing. After the first song, we pause to pass the peace of Christ to one another. We sing both old hymns and contemporary songs. After we sing, the service leader will welcome visitors and give a few announcements about what’s happening in the church. After this we take up an offering, which supports the ministry of the church and is an act of worship. We then dismiss the children (infants to Grade 5) to their Sunday School classes. (If you have kids, we’ll tell you where to go for the Sunday School.) After the children are dismissed, one of the pastors leads us in prayer and another person will read God''s Word. The sermon will explain and apply the text of Scripture that has been read. We conclude with the Lord’s Supper, which we celebrate every Sunday, a closing hymn, and a benediction.'
